This repo contains solutions of all 17 tasks from all qualification and final rounds of
[Yandex.Blitz Machine Learning competition](https://contest.yandex.ru/contest/8470)
held in the end of June, 2018.

Currently only tasks with solutions inside jupyter notebooks have explanatory notes,
but I do plan to update this readme with explanations of all tasks eventually.
